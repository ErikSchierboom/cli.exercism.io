+++

Exercism is an open source project that aims to give people a way to get from that awkward "Hello, World!" in a new programming language to being fluent and at ease with the basic constructs, idioms and standard library of the language.

The project supports over 40 programming languages, each of which contains numerous small exercises.
You work on the exercises locally, in your own development environment and favorite text editor.
Then you submit your solution to the site, where other participants can discuss the code and suggest improvements, and you iterate until you're happy with the solution and what you've learned.

The command-line client (CLI) provides the mechanism for fetching and submitting exercises.
