**Make sure you are on the latest version.**

Verify which version you are on:

    exercism -v

Verify against the [latest
release](https://github.com/exercism/cli/releases/latest) and upgrade if your
version is not the most recent.

After upgrading, double-check the version. If the version didn't change, make
sure you are running the upgraded binary.

    which exercism

**If you are still having trouble open an issue in
[exercism/cli](http://github.com/exercism/cli) on GitHub** with the output of
the `debug` command.

    exercism debug
